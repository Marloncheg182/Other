Project Description

Simple Internet shop.
Some specifications:
- MySQL database with customized MySQL JDBC driver will be a container for products
- Spring MVC for Model ( POJO`s) View (JSP pages with JSTagLibs perhaps we can use JSF + AJAX support for best switching)
Controllers to obtain a connection between Model and View. Dependency Injection to create an independent
connections between classes and objects.
- Servlets for request / respond between client and web shop Server. As Server we will use Jetty container
- We will also use a simple CSS framework Bootstrap 3 with Jumbotron and some other stuff...
- EJB as pattern of some bean examples, to provide a business logic between classes.
- We will input failing case logs in Error log4j2 Trace in File , and Info logs for statistics to another file appender.
- We will use a simple DBunit test for Databases, mock for imitation of client, who made an order, we will also use
hamcrest matcher , TestNG may be implements as main Testing system, supporting multithreading in case if two or more
clients decided to order something.
- Russian/ English internationalization.
Preferences to involve some design patterns , except DAO/Service which will be used by default in CRUD access , in case
if our development will turn in ORM side.
